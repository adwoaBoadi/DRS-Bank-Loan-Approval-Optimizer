# DRS-Bank-Loan-Approval-Optimizer
The "DRS-Bank-Loan-Approval-Optimizer" project is designed to develop a scientifically robust framework for DRS Bank to enhance its loan approval processes. This initiative aims to minimize the risk of loans becoming non-performing assets (NPAs) by identifying key criteria and factors that influence loan delinquency. Through data analysis, the project seeks to pinpoint which variables are most predictive of loan repayment issues and to implement predictive models that aid in making more informed lending decisions for individual customers.


### This project seeks to answer the following key questions:
1. Identify the criteria to approve loans for an individual customer such that the likelihood of the loan delinquency is minimized?
2. What are the factors that drive the behavior of loan delinquency?
