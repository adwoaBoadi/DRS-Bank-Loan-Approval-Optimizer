# DRS-Bank-Loan-Approval-Optimizer
The "DRS-Bank-Loan-Approval-Optimizer" project aims to enhance DRS Bank's loan approval process by identifying key criteria and factors that influence loan delinquency. This initiative uses data analysis to develop predictive models that improve decision-making and minimize non-performing assets (NPAs).
